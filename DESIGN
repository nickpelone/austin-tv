 package.json
 app.js <----- This should drive/start the observa backend as well as the web frontend (express static)

 observa-modules/
             *Core modules will live here*
             ffmpeg-handler
             ffmpeg-distributor <-- implementing is a stretch goal, to push across multiple ec2 instances for encoding
             web-middleware <---- Web interface, web middleware(API endpoints), database stuff
             observa-middleware/  <---this is where the plugins live
                            observa-plugin-youtube/ <--- the reference youtube plugin
                                                     receives a youtube link from web interface(listens on plugin 'daemon')
                                                     calls youtube-dl, gets resulting .mp4 file, is checked,
                                                     and then is sent to the client as the new video element source
             plugin-daemon.js <- would this be better as just the app.js and then launch *everything* as an observa plugin?
